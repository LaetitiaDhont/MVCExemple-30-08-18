MVC Example in JSP
In this example, we are using servlet as a controller, jsp as a view component, Java Bean class as a model.

In this example, we have created 5 pages:

index.jsp a page that gets input from the user.
ControllerServlet.java a servlet that acts as a controller.
login-success.jsp and login-error.jsp files acts as view components.
web.xml file for mapping the servlet.
